# DeliverIQ-Smart_Supply_Chain_Delay_Prediction
Inspired by Accenture SynOps, TCS Enterprise Analytics, Emerson Lifecycle Analytics, and Virtusa dashboards, this project analyzes order-to-delivery, supplier, and last-mile data using SQL, Python, and Power BI to track KPIs, optimize operations, and predict delivery delays.

Project Summary

The AI-Powered Supply Chain Analytics Project is a comprehensive initiative designed to analyze, monitor, and optimize end-to-end supply chain operations. The project combines data engineering, descriptive analytics, predictive modeling, and interactive dashboards to provide actionable insights for operational decision-making. It focuses on delivery performance, supplier efficiency, cost management, and risk mitigation, while laying the foundation for AI-driven forecasting of potential delays.

1. Business Problem

In supply chain operations, companies face challenges such as:
Delayed deliveries impacting customer satisfaction
Cost inefficiencies and unoptimized transportation
Lack of visibility into warehouse, supplier, and regional performance
Difficulty predicting high-risk orders or future delays
The project aims to address these challenges by integrating historical operational data with analytics and predictive insights, enabling business leaders to make data-driven decisions.

2. Data Collection & Structure
The project uses structured operational data stored in CSV format:

Key columns include:
Order Information: Order_ID, Order_Date, Ship_Date, Planned_Delivery_Date, Actual_Delivery_Date
Performance Metrics: Delay_Days, On_Time, Lead_Time_days
Product & Supplier Details: Product, Supplier, Quantity, Cost, Revenue, Supplier_Reliability_Score
Operational Context: Region, Warehouse, Transport_Mode, Courier, Damage_Report, Last_Mile_Events, Last_Mile_Duration_hours
Financial Metrics: Cost_per_unit, Profit_Margin (calculated)

Data Preparation Steps:
Validation: Ensure correct data types (numeric, date, text)
Cleaning: Handle missing, inconsistent, or erroneous values
Derived Metrics: Calculate delay days, on-time delivery %, profit margin, delay categories
Aggregation-ready: Prepare data for visual analytics and predictive modeling

3. Analytics & Modeling

3.1 Descriptive Analytics
Focuses on what happened in the supply chain:
Average delays per warehouse, region, or supplier
On-time delivery percentage trends over time
Cost vs delay analysis
Delay categorization: High, Low, On Time
Tools & Techniques: DAX measures in Power BI, aggregations, and categorical segmentation

3.2 Diagnostic Analytics
Explores why delays occur:
Correlation between delivery delays and cost, transport mode, or supplier reliability
Identification of underperforming warehouses or regions
Analysis of last-mile events and their impact on delivery times

3.3 Predictive Analytics (Future/AI Layer)
Focuses on forecasting potential delays using historical data:
Input features: Lead_Time_days, Supplier_Reliability_Score, Last_Mile_Duration_hours, Transport_Mode, etc.
Techniques: Machine learning regression/classification models to predict delay probability or expected delay days
Outcome: Proactive alerts for high-risk shipments and better operational planning

4. Key Metrics & Measures

Metric	Purpose
Total Orders	Operational volume
Average Delay	Efficiency of fulfillment
On-Time Delivery %	Customer satisfaction and reliability
Profit Margin %	Financial performance
Delay Category	Operational risk segmentation

6. Visualization & Reporting

Interactive dashboards are created in Power BI to present the insights to business users:
KPI Cards: Total Orders, Avg Delay, Profit Margin, On-Time %
Bar Charts: Average Delay per Warehouse or Supplier
Line Charts: Trends in On-Time Delivery % over time
Pie Charts: Delay Category proportions
Scatter Plots: Cost vs Delay_Days for multi-dimensional analysis
Tables & Slicers: Drill-down details and interactive filters
Purpose: Make insights business-readable, enable data-driven decisions, and highlight high-risk areas for corrective action.

6. Insights & Recommendations

Warehouses or suppliers with frequent delays are easily identified
High-cost delays are correlated with certain regions or transport modes
Operational improvements can be planned based on last-mile delivery events
Financial efficiency (profit margin) can be monitored against delays
Supports proactive supply chain planning and resource allocation

7. Tools & Technologies

Power BI: Dashboarding and visualization
DAX: Custom KPI measures and calculations
Python / Excel (optional): Data preparation and cleaning
Machine Learning (Future Layer): Predictive delay modeling
CSV: Structured operational dataset

8. Project Workflow (Conceptual)

Collect and clean operational supply chain data
Calculate essential metrics and KPIs (descriptive analytics)
Explore correlations and patterns (diagnostic analytics)
Build Power BI dashboards for stakeholders
Integrate predictive models for AI-driven insights (optional)
Generate actionable recommendations for supply chain optimization

9. Outcomes

Operational visibility across warehouses, suppliers, and regions
Identification of key drivers of delays and cost inefficiency
Interactive dashboards for executives and operations teams
Foundation for AI-enabled predictive decision-making
